# Microsoft Graph Webhooks sample using WebJobs SDK
Subscribe for [Microsoft Graph webhooks](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/webhooks) to be notified when your user's data changes so you don't have to poll for changes.

This Azure WebJobs sample shows how to start getting notifications from Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph provides a unified API endpoint to access data from the Microsoft cloud. 

>This sample uses the Azure AD endpoint to obtain an access token for work or school accounts. The sample uses a application-only permission, however delegated-permissions should also work.

The following are common tasks that an application performs with webhooks subscriptions:

- Get consent to subscribe to users' resources and then get an access token.
- Use the access token to [create a subscription](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/api/subscription_post_subscriptions) to a resource.
- Send back a validation token to confirm the notification URL.
- Listen for notifications from Microsoft Graph and respond with a 202 status code.
- Request more information about changed resources using data in the notification.

After the app creates a subscription using app-only auth token , Microsoft Graph sends a notification to the registered notification endpoint when events happen in the user's data. The app then reacts to the event.

This sample subscribes to the `Users` resource for `updated` and "deleted' changes. The sample assumes that the notification URL is an [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview), which listens for webhook over http and immediately enqueues those notifications to an Azure storage queue. The sample uses [Azure WebJobs SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/websites-dotnet-webjobs-sdk) to bind to the Azure storage queue, and receive new notifications as they are queued by the Azure function.

## Prerequisites

To use the Microsoft Graph ASP.NET Webhooks sample, you need the following:

* Visual Studio 2015 installed on your development computer. 

* A [work or school account](http://dev.office.com/devprogram).

* The application ID and key from the application that you [register on the Azure Portal](#register-the-app).

* A public HTTPS endpoint to receive and send HTTP requests. You can host this on Microsoft Azure or another service. This sample was tested using [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview)

* An Azure storage account that will be used by [Azure WebJobs SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/websites-dotnet-webjobs-sdk) 

### Register the app

This app uses the Azure AD endpoint, so you'll register it in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Sign in to the portal using your work or school account.

2. Choose **Azure Active Directory** in the left-hand navigation pane.

3. Choose **App registrations**, and then choose **New application registration**.  

   a. Enter a friendly name for the application.

   b. Choose 'Web app/API' as the **Application Type**.

   c. Enter *https://mysigninurl for the **Sign-on URL**. 
  
   d. Click **Create**.

4. Choose your new application from the list of registered applications.

5. Copy and store the Application ID. This value is shown in the **Essentials** pane or in **Settings** > **Properties**.

6. To enable multi-tenanted support for the app, choose **Settings** > **Properties** and set **Multi-tenanted** to **Yes**.

7. Configure permissions for your application:  

   a. Choose **Settings** > **Required permissions** > **Add**.
  
   b. Choose **Select an API** > **Microsoft Graph**, and then click **Select**.
  
   c. Choose **Select permissions**, scroll down to **Application Permissions**, choose **Read directory data**, and then click **Select**.
  
   d. Click **Done**.
   
   e. Click **Grant Permissions**

8. Choose **Settings** > **Keys**. Enter a description, choose a duration for the key, and then click **Save**.

9. **Important**: Copy the key value--this is your app's secret. You won't be able to access this value again after you leave this blade.

You'll use the application ID and secret to configure the app in Visual Studio.


### Set up Azure function
You must expose a public HTTPS endpoint to create a subscription and receive notifications from Microsoft Graph. You can use Azure Functions for the same.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using your work or school account.

2. Choose **Function Apps** in the left-hand navigation pane.

3. Follow instructions to create a new **Function App**

4. Create a new **WebHook/API** function with following sample code

'''cs
using System.Net;

public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, ICollector<string> queue, TraceWriter log)
{
    log.Info("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

    // parse query parameter
    string validationToken = req.GetQueryNameValuePairs()
        .FirstOrDefault(q => string.Compare(q.Key, "validationToken", true) == 0)
        .Value;
    
    log.Info("validationToken: " + validationToken);

    // Get request body
    string data = await req.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    log.Info("Body of request: " + data);

    queue.Add(data);

    log.Info("Added message to queue");

    return string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(validationToken)
        ? req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Accepted, "Notification received")
        : req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, validationToken);
}
'''
5. Choose **Integrate** 

6. Choose **New Output**

7. Select **Azure Queue Blob** 

8. Enter **queue** as **Message Parameter name**

9. Enter **webhooksnotificationqueue** as **Queue name**

10. Use an existing or create a new **Storage account connection**

11. Choose the function created and **Run** from the portal to make sure that it succeeds.

12. Choose on **Get function URL** to copy the notification url to be used in the sample.

### Setup sample project

1. In Solution Explorer, select the **App.config** project.

	a. For the **clientId** key, replace *ENTER_YOUR_APP_ID* with the application ID of your registered Azure application.
	
	b. For the **clientSecret** key, replace *ENTER_YOUR_SECRET* with the key of your registered Azure application.  
	
	c. For the **tenantId** key, replace *ENTER_YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID* with id of your organization.

	d. For the **webjobs** key, replace *ENTER_YOUR_AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING* with connection string of azure storage integrated in Azure function.
	
	e. For the **notificationurl** key, replace *ENTER_YOUR_NOTIFICATION_URL* with URL of Azure function.

### Use the sample App
1. Press **F5** to start your sample.

2. Wait for sample to print the message **Created new subscription with id:**

3. Update any property of any user in the organization. Example: Update their phone number

4. In a few minutes, sample should receive notification for the updated user along with their identification.

5. Every 30 seconds, sample will renew subscription. One can change the time period of updaqte operation to be once every 24 hours.

## Key components of the sample

**Controllers**  
- [`Function.cs`](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/aspnet-webhooks-rest-sample/blob/master/GraphWebhooks/Controllers/NotificationController.cs) Receives notifications.  
- [`Program.cs`](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/aspnet-webhooks-rest-sample/blob/master/GraphWebhooks/Controllers/SubscriptionController.cs) Creates and receives webhook subscriptions.
 
## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|:------|:------|
| You get a 403 Forbidden response when you attempt to create a subscription. | Make sure that your app registration includes the **Read directory data** application permission for Microsoft Graph (as described in the [Register the app](#register-the-app) section). |  
| You do not receive notifications. | Check the logs for Azure function in [portal](https://portal.azure.com/). If Microsoft Graph is not sending notifications, please open a [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/MicrosoftGraph) issue tagged *[MicrosoftGraph]*. Include the subscription ID and the time it was created.<br /><br /> |  
| You get a *Subscription validation request timed out* response. | This indicates that Microsoft Graph did not receive a validation response within the expected timeframe (about 10 seconds).<br /><br />If you created Azure function on **consumption plan** then the function can go to sleep due to inactivity. The sample will try again and should succeed in next attempts. Alternately, try creating Azure function using App service plan. |  
| You get errors while installing packages. | Make sure the local path where you placed the solution is not too long/deep. Moving the solution closer to the root drive resolves this issue. |
